# Hard Work Brings Overnight Success

Tell the story of "I was here first" @ PHPNW, that they weren't there to see me voted Best Speaker on the php|cruise 2004, and that they in turn weren't there to see me addressing Heads of Depts upwards at Sheffield about moving to WinNT back in 1997/8.

Tell the story of people who refused to work for me because I work so hard.
