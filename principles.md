# Principles Before Practices

I first came across the importance of principles when I first began studying the martial art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan under Robert Earl Taylor.  I was 26 at the time, and already an accomplished leader and software programmer, but I'd always felt that there was something fundamental missing from my understanding of why I'd been successful to date.

Right from the first class, where I was an awkward tangle of arms and legs, Robert was always relating everything he taught us back to the underlying idea.  You stand like this in order to relax the hips.  You place your foot down like this in order to achieve single weight.  You relax your shoulders to keep your elbows low.  And so on, and so on.

Now, at the time, I didn't really get it, which was okay, because I knew that here I was seeing in action something completely different to anything I'd come across before.  I spent as much time as I could learning from Robert - and Robert was supremely generous with his time - but it was only after I started teaching T'ai Chi Ch'uan myself, after Robert's death, that I started to get a handle on the power of being led by principles.  The principles themselves became my teacher, and they continue to guide me in my practice to this day.

I was able to take this approach - principle-led activity - and put it into practice in my professional life.  During my time running the engineering at a small telecomms firm, the firm was able to step up and bag several national awards for the first time in its history.  Sadly, there's a hard lesson there, as the telco wasn't able to maintain its national recognition after I left.  Ultimately, you have to serve principles in order to succeed with them.  By their nature, they're not something you can set aside, and as thinking human beings with egos that bruise, it's a very hard thing to learn to do.

## Understanding The True Nature Of Things

One of my favourite cartoons as a child was Warner Bros.'s Roadrunner.  If you haven't seen it, they're short stories about Wily E. Coyote's increasingly desperate and absurd attempts to capture the Roadrunner, so that he can eat it for dinner.  Every time that I watch them, I always end up crying from laughing so much.

Wily E. Coyote always fails to catch the Roadrunner because the physics in the cartoon world don't work the way he thinks they do.  Traps don't get sprung; explosives don't do the damage he expects; heck, even gravity doesn't seem to apply to bird and beast alike.  Everything he tries always rebounds upon himself, and the more he tries to overcome the cartoon physics, the worse the consequences for him.  It's funny because it's so absurd.

Right there, in several hours of 5 minute animated shorts, is the lesson of principles, repeated over and over and over until you can't laugh any more because it hurts too much.  It doesn't matter how much you believe in them ... if your mental models and the principles you try to apply don't match the true nature of things, you'll just run into problems all the time.

## Mental Models

In our heads, we all have models of how the world works.  We have vague and fluffy models for how large concepts work.  We have smaller, detailed models for how everyday things work.  We don't normally think about these models, and most of the time we're unaware that they're there, and we follow them without realising that we do so.  These models guide our minds in everything that we do, because they are what we think reality is.  Our models are our perception of reality.

Just like in the Roadrunner cartoon, reality operates on its own laws.

When we talk about "harsh realities", we're often referring to a sudden realisation that our models have been wrong for so long that they've led us into serious trouble.

Models are fundamental to how we function as people, and to how successful we are at developing and harnessing our talents.  And yet, maybe because they're something we _have_ to do naturally in order to survive, they're something that we spend so little time on.

That's where principles come in.

## What Is A Principle?

A principle is a strategy and an outcome, both at the same time.  It is something you achieve, and by doing so, it allows you to achieve your goals.

A set of principles together are the source of a model that describe the nature of something.  They are not the model itself, because that exists only in your mind!

Principles are independent of how you achieve them.

## Principles Are Not Attitudes Or Behaviours

We seem to be living in the era of the "positive mental attitude", that if you can only learn to smile at everything and be a glass-half-full person, great things can be achieved.  It's a theme that I'll be challenging throughout this book.

The idea is well-intentioned ... that your thinking is holding you back.  To be fair, it probably is.  Your models affect your decisions.

## Why Are Principles Important?

The late Dr Stephen R. Covey described principles as being like a compass, that they are ideas that point you in the right direction.

## How Do We Discover Principles?

## How Do We Learn From Principles?

We learn from principles by putting them into practice.
